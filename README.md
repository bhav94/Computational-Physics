# Computational-Physics

Projects completed as a part of the Computational Physics course at California State University, Los Angeles. \
Projects will be displayed as follows: **PROJECT TITLE**: *Description*

**Making Best Fit Lines for Linear Data**: *an exercise in creating linear best fit lines for sets of data and observing how the best fit lines change as individual elements of the data set change.*

**Final Project: Data Analysis & Differential Equations**: *These are two separate mini-projects. Data analysis project makes use of Seaborn and Pandas python packages to study the number of women graduating with STEM degrees. The differential equation project uses SciPy to solve a damped harmonic oscillator.
